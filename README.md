# ALLAI
ALLAI's name stands for Advanced Language Learning Artificial Intelligence, a talking AI created to serve as a domestic assistant and conversation partner.

## Learning Process:
###### First Learning
ALLAI is capable of learning a new language, or learn more about a already known language, by reading books. When the program reads a book, it creates three different databases to store all extracted information, and, with it, the capacity of composing new phrases.
First Learning process may take several hours to create the entire database. The waiting time could be as long as seven hours.
###### Continuous Learning
Besides reading, ALLAI is learning every time it talks with you. Each sentence you send to ALLAI will be analyzed, and the databases will be updated. ALLAI also analyzes the phrase you just answered to, in order to update the possible answers database.

## Supported Languages:
Right now ALLAI supports only Spanish, although ALLAI's core is prepared to analyze and learn any phonographic alphabet based language. 
The reason Spanish is the only currently supported language is that the algorithm recognized the most important words in a phrase in order to create a response, and this is language dependent, as well as the domestic assistance pre-builded responses.

## Notes:
Please remember this is a work in progress. A lot of work is still pending. If you would like to test ALLAI, you may talk with him/her on this server: [ALLAI-Server](http://allai.dynu.net). Remember, ALLAI only supports spanish at the moment!
